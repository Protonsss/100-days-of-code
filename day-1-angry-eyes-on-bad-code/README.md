# day 1: angry eyes on bad code

so basically this code uses your webcam to detect faces and then puts angry eyes on them. idk why but i thought it would be funny to see my own face with angry eyes. works surprisingly well, but sometimes crashes if you look at it wrong.

## why i made this
honestly, i was bored and procrastinating on studying for my exams. also, i thought it would be a good first project for this 100-day coding challenge thing to impress colleges.

## how to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## what i learned
i learned that opencv is kinda jank but also really powerful. also, i should probably learn how to use git properly.

## known bugs
sometimes it freaks out and crashes if there's not enough light or if you move too fast. also, the eye detection isn't perfect, so sometimes it puts the angry eyes in weird places.
