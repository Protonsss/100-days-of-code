# day 1: sleepy mouth checker

so basically this thing uses your webcam to check if your mouth is open for too long. if it is, it plays an alarm sound. idk why but I thought it would be funny to make something that yells at me if i fall asleep. works surprisingly well, but sometimes crashes if you look at it wrong.

## why i made this
honestly, i keep falling asleep during online lectures. i need something to keep me awake that isn't coffee. plus i needed a project for this 100 day coding challenge.

## how to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## what i learned
i learned that dlib is actually pretty easy to use. also, i need more sleep.

## known bugs
sometimes it thinks my mouth is open when it's not. probably a lighting issue. also crashes sometimes idk why.
