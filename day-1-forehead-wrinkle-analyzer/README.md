# day 1: forehead wrinkle analyzer

so basically, this thing takes an image of your face, tries to find your forehead, and then counts the wrinkles it sees. why i made this? tbh i was staring at myself in the mirror and got curious.

## why i made this
was bored and wanted to see how many wrinkles i have. plus, i heard admission officers like seeing random projects. this is as random as it gets lol

## how to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## what i learned
i learned that image processing is harder than it looks, and that i definitely need more sleep.

## known bugs
kinda buggy but sometimes it mistakes eyebrows for wrinkles. also, sometimes crashes if you look at it wrong.
