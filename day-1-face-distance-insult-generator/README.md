# day 1: face distance insult generator

so basically this thing uses your webcam to figure out how far away your face is from the screen and then insults you based on that distance. idk why but it seemed like a funny idea at 2am. works surprisingly well, kinda buggy but what doesn't these days.

## why i made this
thought making a program that roasts people would be a good start. gotta show off my personality somehow, right?

## how to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## what i learned
i learned way more about face detection with opencv than i ever wanted to. also, insulting people programmatically is harder than it looks.

## known bugs
sometimes crashes if you look at it wrong. might need better insults too, suggestions welcome 👍.
