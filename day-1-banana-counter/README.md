# day 1: banana counter

so basically this thing detects bananas in your webcam feed and counts them. why? honestly idk, i was hungry. works surprisingly well, like 70% of the time.

## why i made this
I was eating a banana and thought it would be funny to make a program that counts them. Also, I need projects for my college apps, so here we are.

## how to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## what i learned
I learned that OpenCV is kinda annoying to set up. Also, cascade classifiers are neat!

## known bugs
sometimes crashes if you look at it wrong 🍌
