# day 1: finger drum detector

so basically this thing uses your webcam to detect when you're "drumming" in the air with your finger. it draws a green rectangle to show the drum area and counts how many times you hit it with your index finger. kinda buggy but works surprisingly well lol.

## why i made this
honestly? because i was bored and wanted to see if i could. also, i have a midterm tomorrow and needed a distraction. this was more fun than studying.

## how to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## what i learned
i learned that mediapipe is actually pretty cool, and also that i'm REALLY bad at air drumming.

## known bugs
sometimes it thinks my cat is drumming. also sometimes crashes if you look at it wrong.
